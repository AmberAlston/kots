# Kotsadm

Kotsadm is an installable admin console for managing KOTS applications. Kotsadm provides a nextgen admin experience for any KOTS application, designed to meet the needs of a wide spectrum of enterprise IT admins, from a “click-to-deploy” model to “automated operations”.

Once deployed, Kotsadm gives administrators the ability to get an application configured and deployed using step-through configuration, automated preflight checks and one-click updates. 

For advanced cluster operators, we recommend setting up the GitOps & internal registry integrations to move away from click-to-deploy and instead leverage an Kotsadm's automated operations.
